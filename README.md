# Frontend Mentor Challenges

Welcome to my **Frontend Mentor Challenges** repository!  
This repo contains my personal solutions to challenges provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/), a platform that helps developers improve their front-end coding skills by building real projects.

Each challenge is organized into its own Git branch, following best practices and using semantic HTML, responsive CSS, and accessibility principles.

## üîÄ Branch Structure

Each challenge is stored in a separate branch named after the project.  
To explore a specific challenge:

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

Example:

```bash
git checkout recipe-page
```

## üìÅ What's Inside
Each branch typically includes:
- index.html ‚Äì the main HTML file
- style.css ‚Äì the custom styles following the design system
- README.md ‚Äì challenge-specific details (brief, tools used, live link)
- assets/ ‚Äì any assets provided by Frontend Mentor


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- HTML5 & CSS3
- Responsive Layouts (mobile-first)
- Accessibility (WCAG principles)
- Vanilla JS (in relevant challenges)
- Git for version control
- Optionally: React, Tailwind, etc. (for advanced challenges)
